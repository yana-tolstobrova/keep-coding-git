*Git* ours who art in the repos
Compressed be thy *commits*
Thy *log* come to us
In the local as in the *remote*
Give us today our *pull* of each day
Forgive us our *conflicts*
As we also forgive those of other geeks
Do not let us fall into *detached HEAD*
and deliver us from *SVN*
`git commit --amend`
